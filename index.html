    <p class="About">
      I'm a software developer currently based in Portland, OR. Before getting into software development I studied music at Berklee College of Music, Media Studies at The New School and worked as an audio engineer an producer in Brooklyn, NY. <br />
      <br />
      Programming and software development is my focus nowadays, but when
      i'm not doing that i'm making strange noises with modular synthesizers,
      building DIY audio equipment or enjoying all the wonderful things the
      Pacific NW has to offer.
