    <div class="About">
      <p>
        I worked as an audio engineer and musician in the independent music scene in NYC for a decade before discovering that writing code was just as fulfilling to me as writing and recording music. <br />
        <br />
      Programming and software development is my main focus these days, but when i'm not doing that i'm making strange noises with modular synthesizers, building DIY audio equipment or enjoying all the wonderful things the Pacific NW has to offer.
